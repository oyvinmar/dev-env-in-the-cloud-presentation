# :house_with_garden:

## Is repo up to date?

- Are dependencies up to date?
- Any new environment variables?
- Does the feature depend on any other services?

---

## Is development env up to date?

- Build tools (yarn, npm, maven)
- Runtime (node, java, python, docker)
- Development tools (git, terminal, editor, browser)

---

## I'm always tinkering

- Changing shell exports/aliases
- Installing new command line tools
- Changing config

# 2. More power

---

# MacBook 12inch

## 1,3 GHz Intel Core m7

<Notes>

- Works for web development, but not for heavy tasks (i.e. multiple docker containers)

## On demand scalability
