<Notes>

- Status at the end of workday
- N.B. I prefer not to tavel with a laptop

##

# :office:

```bash
git commit -am "wip"
git push
```

<Notes>

Just use Git. Problem solved.

</Notes>

---

# :house_with_garden:

```bash
git pull
git checkout --track accordion-improvements
yarn start
```

<Notes>

Easy right?

</Notes>

---

## Is repo up to date?

- Are dependencies up to date?
- Any new environment variables?
- Does the feature depend on any other services?

---

## Is development env up to date?

- Build tools (yarn, npm, maven)
- Runtime (node, java, python, docker)
- Development tools (git, terminal, editor, browser)

---

## I'm always tinkering

- Changing shell exports/aliases
- Installing new command line tools
- Changing config

---

# Motivation

## Continue where I left of

## \*All that power

## Curiosity

---

# MacBook 12"

## 1,3 GHz Intel Core m7

<Notes>

Computer at home

- Works for web development, but not for heavy tasks (i.e. multiple docker containers)
-

</Notes>

---

## On demand scalability

# Curiosity

- Facebook/Google/Microsoft have internal solutions
- Great for onboarding?
- Develop on an tablet (i.e. iPad)

<Notes>

- Facebook/Google/Microsoft have internal solutions.
- Automating project development setup
- Good bye MacBook

</Notes>

---

<!--- Setup -->

# Cloud setup

- Cloud
- Client

---

<img src="public/DO_Logo_Horizontal_Blue.png" />

<Appear>

- Cheap and predictable pricing
- Simple interface
- Already had an account

</Appear>

---

## Server setup

- Ubuntu
- Development tools (git, Node.js, etc)
- SSH login
- NGINX
- Let's Encrypt

<Notes>

- Pretty strait forward.
- Ubuntu with firewall enabled.
- An alternative to NGINX is SSH port forwarding.

</Notes>

# Editing code

<video src="public/coding.mp4" autoPlay loop />

---

## Approaches

- SSH
- rsync + watchman
- Nuclide
- VSCode remote-development extension

---

## Keep it simple, stupid (KISS)

Use ssh and run vim or emacs on the server

<Notes>

- I prefer VSCode

</Notes>

---

## rsync + watchman

  style={{
    padding: '0 2em',
  }}
/>

<img
  src="public/watchman_logo.png"
  style={{
    padding: '0 2em',
  }}
/>

<Notes>

- Use watchman to watch for local filechanges and use rsync to send them to the server

</Notes>

---

## All tooling must run locally

<Notes>

For example linting, type checking, compiling etc
